To get the info of each file :

`ls -l - h`

To know size of entire folder :

du → “Disk Usage” — shows how much space files or directories use.

-s → Summarize — only give the total size, not every single file inside.

-h → Human-readable — format sizes in KB, MB, GB instead of raw bytes.

`du -sh <FolderName>`


to show each file in size KD :

`ls -l - k`
